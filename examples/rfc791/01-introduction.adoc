== 1.1 Motivation

The Internet Protocol is designed for use in interconnected systems of packet-switched computer communication networks. Such a system has been called a "catenet" [1]. The internet protocol provides for transmitting blocks of data called datagrams from sources to destinations, where sources and destinations are hosts identified by fixed length addresses. The internet protocol also provides for fragmentation and reassembly of long datagrams, if necessary, for transmission through "small packet" networks.

[TIP]
.Creative Explanation: The "Catenet"
====
Imagine the internet as a global postal system made up of many independent local courier services (networks). The "Catenet" is the system that links these all together. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the standard envelope and addressing scheme that allows a letter (datagram) to travel from a courier in New York to a courier in Tokyo, even if they use different trucks or sorting methods.

== 1.2 Scope

The internet protocol is specifically limited in scope to provide the functions necessary to deliver a package of bits (an internet datagram) from a source to a destination over an interconnected system of networks. There are no mechanisms to augment end-to-end data reliability, flow control, sequencing, or other services commonly found in host-to-host protocols. The internet protocol can capitalize on the services of its supporting networks to provide various types and qualities of service.

== 1.3 Interfaces

This protocol is called on by host-to-host protocols in an internet environment. This protocol calls on local network protocols to carry the internet datagram to the next gateway or destination host.

For example, a TCP module would call on the internet module to take a TCP segment (including the TCP header and user data) as the data portion of an internet datagram. The TCP module would provide the addresses and other parameters in the internet header to the internet module as arguments of the call. The internet module would then create an internet datagram and call on the local network interface to transmit the internet datagram.

[NOTE]
.Analogy: The Russian Doll
====
Think of network protocols like Russian nesting dolls.
* The **User Data** is the smallest doll inside.
* **TCP** puts that doll inside a slightly larger one (the TCP Segment).
* **IP** takes the TCP doll and puts it inside its own envelope (the IP Datagram).
* Finally, the **Local Network** (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi) puts the IP envelope into its own box (the Frame) to move it to the next router.

== 1.4 Operation

The internet protocol implements two basic functions: **addressing** and **fragmentation**.

The internet modules use the addresses carried in the internet header to transmit internet datagrams toward their destinations. The selection of a path for transmission is called routing.

The internet modules use fields in the internet header to fragment and reassemble internet datagrams when necessary for transmission through "small packet" networks.

The model of operation is that an internet module resides in each host engaged in internet communication and in each gateway that interconnects networks. These modules share common rules for interpreting address fields and for fragmenting and assembling internet datagrams. In addition, these modules (especially in gateways) have procedures for making routing decisions and other functions.

The internet protocol treats each internet datagram as an independent entity unrelated to any other internet datagram. There are no connections or logical circuits (virtual or otherwise).

The internet protocol uses four key mechanisms in providing its service:
* Type of Service
* Time to Live
* Options
* Header Checksum

=== Key Mechanisms

* **Type of Service**: Used to indicate the quality of the service desired. This is an abstract set of parameters characterizing service choices (e.g., low delay, high reliability).
* **Time to Live (TTL)**: An indication of an upper bound on the lifetime of an internet datagram. It is like a self-destruct timer. If the TTL hits zero, the packet is discarded.
* **Options**: Provisions for control functions like timestamps, security, and special routing.
* **Header Checksum**: Verifies that the information used in processing the internet datagram has been transmitted correctly.

[WARNING]
.Unreliable Delivery
====
IP is "best effort". It does not promise that your packet will arrive. It's like sending a postcard without registered mail. If it gets lost, IP doesn't automatically resend it—that's the job of higher-level protocols like TCP (the sender) to notice and retry.
